# WebServer-GO-REACT
 
This project its still pretty early on.

It already connects the backend to frontend using gorilla websocket and send a json with email, name, password to the backend to further work

It already sanitizes the inputs and hash the password

I'm working on DB rigth now to register everything.

I want for this project:

1-Be able to register and login with a password hashed

2-Implement any kind of currency system and a place for the user to store some personal data.

3-Be able to spend/get currency with the correct implementation to prevent "fraud"

4-Implement an email verification.


I'll probably use a pretty simple html/css
